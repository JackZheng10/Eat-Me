-Organize files for views into these folders, and use component sub-folders for them as well
-Standardize the layout (nesting of container/view/whatever we want to use)

-Different grid system?
-Clean up the server stuff. Split into proper routes/controllers
-Styling. It hurts so much on mobile. MUI spoils people
