-Organize files for views into these folders, and use component sub-folders for them as well
-Standardize the layout (nesting of container/view/whatever we want to use)
-Different grid system? Or figure out current one. May not even need one. See: https://github.com/react-native-elements/react-native-elements-app
-Clean up the server stuff. Split into proper routes/controllers
-Organize packages into backend (root folder) and frontend (client folder)
-For styles, use a themeprovider?
-Uninstall unused packages
-Standardize style naming convention + styling convention stuff
-Other bottom bar option: https://reactnavigation.org/docs/material-bottom-tab-navigator/#screenoptions
-Example that would wrap app:
<ThemeProvider
              theme={{
                Input: {
                  containerStyle: {
                    width: SCREEN_WIDTH - 50,
                  },
                  inputContainerStyle: {
                    borderRadius: 40,
                    borderWidth: 1,
                    borderColor: 'rgba(110, 120, 170, 1)',
                    height: 50,
                    marginVertical: 10,
                  },
                  placeholderTextColor: 'rgba(110, 120, 170, 1)',
                  inputStyle: {
                    marginLeft: 10,
                    color: 'white',
                  },
                  keyboardAppearance: 'light',
                  blurOnSubmit: false,
                },
              }}

            //Notes: Some supplied props to each element are documented while others are not, this will require some digging around the src code.
